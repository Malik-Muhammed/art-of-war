                        The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was 
                        born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later 
                        Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was 
                        born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the 
                        late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a 
                        general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth 
                        century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then 
                        inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of 
                        the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent 
                        Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven 
                        ancient Chinese states-Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and 
                        Yan who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in 
                        Eastern China.

                    <p>
                        This Collectable Hardbound Deluxe Edition is beautifully crafted and 
                        designed. Perfect for gifting as well as for keeps. A prized edition for any 
                        library. The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life 
                        and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry 
                        which can on no account be neglected. The Art of War is an enduring classic 
                        that holds a special place in the culture and history of East Asia. An ancient 
                        Chinese text on the philosophy and politics of warfare and military strategy, 
                        the treatise was written in 6th century B.C. by a warrior-philosopher now 
                        famous all over the world as Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu s teachings remain as relevant 
                        to leaders and strategists today as they were to rulers and military generals 
                        in ancient times. Divided into thirteen chapters and written succinctly, The 
                        Art of War is a must read for anybody who works in an competitive 
                        environment or who is interested in warfare, strategy and Chinese history.
